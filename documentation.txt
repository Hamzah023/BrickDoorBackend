okay how do i design this:

react frontend, backend spring boot, database postgres or MySQL, file storage was s3
optional:
caching redis
queue kafka or smth

so the MVP I wanna make is a react UI with a search page for company threads, and a page for each company thread, where there can be tweets about experiences with the company for co-ops

and I wanna make a page to create a new company thread if there isn't one already

1. search page for company threads (the entry of the application)
2. a page for each company thread
3.  a page to create a new company thread if there isn't one already

for 1. the backend should be able to filter the database for any matching the users input in the search

for 2. the backend should do idk what maybe return the info to the frontend to show in the webpage such as company thread and company posts

for 3. the backend should register the info in the database maybe

I've heard of the MVC design pattern for springboot, but what design should I do this with to mimic scalable applications like Instagram, twitter, or reddit

do authentication so making sure the user is logged in (after doing the main 3)

How does MVC work here:

In a Spring Boot MVC backend, the Model, Service, and Repository work together like this:

1️⃣ Frontend (React) makes a request to GET /api/threads/google
2️⃣ Controller receives the request and calls the Service
3️⃣ Service processes business logic and calls the Repository
4️⃣ Repository interacts with the database and returns the data
5️⃣ Service returns the data to the Controller
6️⃣ Controller sends a JSON response to React
7️⃣ React displays the data in the UI

the database is postgressql, since it is an object relational database, which is helpful for springboot


WHAT TO MAKE: 2/19/25

Homepage with search bar (get request to backend controller to get any company communities like reddit)

company community page (get request to backend controller to get any posts like reddit)

make a new company community (post request to backend controller to make a new community)

make a new post in a company community (post request to backend controller to make a new post)

I will first start making the post object controller, service, repository, entity


commands:
http://localhost:8080/community for get request

postgres-# \c brickdoordb1
You are now connected to database "brickdoordb1" as user "hamzah".
brickdoordb1-#

run the springboot application
mvn spring-boot:run


http://localhost:8080/community \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "Test Community",
  "description": "A sample description for the community"
}'
